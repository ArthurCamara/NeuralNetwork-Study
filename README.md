# NeuralNetwork-Study
##A bunch of code snippets and examples for studying Neural Networks.
Everything here will be commented as needed.
Code will be writen in Python. Mostly, using [iPython
notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

Here is a list of sources that I used while studying this. This list
will be updated as more code get's introduced.
